<h3><b>About</b></h3>
<p><b>What it Does</b>:<br />
This script makes interactions between Kong and Dawn of the Dragons easier in a number of ways.<br />
<b>1:</b> It customizes the way raid links are displayed so instead of getting the DOTD image and name you get information about the raid such as raid name, difficulty, fair share, optimal share and more!<br />
<b>2:</b> Allows for certain raids to be hidden, such as those seen before, those you have already clicked on, or all raids.<br />
<b>3:</b> Adds a tab to kongregate&#39;s chat to make toggling options easier and to view the raids you have seen posted in chat.<br />
<b>4:</b> Adds a few commands to the chat input box to make things a little easier. These commands include, /clear, /toggle, /raid, and many more (see below)<br />
<b>5:</b> Allows direct import of lists of raids, as well as support for large lists of raids stored on pastebin.<br/><br/>

<br><br>
<b>1.1.1</b><br>
1) Hot fix for pastebin exporting in FireFox.
<br><br>
<b>1.1.0</b><br>
1) Modified raid actions interface to allow for more advanced selection and action. Also gives a count of the number of "selected" raids.  Dead raids can now be selected, but the only action which can be performed on them is "Delete".<br/>
2) Added pastebin auto export ("Paste" button in raid actions).  You must be logged into pastebin in your browser and enter the pastebin record you want it to auto update on the options tab. Option to auto post your pastebin to chat after updating added to options tab as well. <br/>
3) Added /mute, /unmute, and /mutelist commands for muting users.  Muting users through the script will not prevent any raids or pastebins posted by them to be added to the script.  The proper syntax is "/mute [username]" or "/unmute username".  The command "/unmute all" can be used to unmute all muted users.</br>

10) Fixed bug that was occasionally causing some raids not to import on the first try.<br/>
11) Added handling when pastebin imports time out.<br/>
12) Added automatic script update checking and notification.<br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>1.0.1</b><br>
1) Quick hotfix adding Krykagrius new world raid.<br/><br/>
<b>1.0.0</b><br>
1) Added pastebin tab with basic information.  Pastebins can be favorited by clicking the star next to them, this will prevent them from being purged.  Pastebin purging occurs after 24 hours.<br />
2) Revamped raid searching significantly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a) You can now search for multiple items in the boss search window, using several different separators.  "bel|bus|guil" = "bel or bus or guil" = "bel,bus,guil".  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The existing keyword search functionality has been greatly expanded.  In addition to the existing keywords (z1, z2, ... z9), you can now search by most common drops (runestone, glyph, war horn, dragon eye pearls, etc. etc.).  In addition, the keyword <b>farm</b> will search for all glyph raids, erebus, mazalu, and grune.<br/>
3) A chat overlay has been added so the user can monitor the script's status while chatting.  An option is available to enable or disable this feature.<br/>
4) Raids can now be loaded into the game without refreshing the game window.  Uncheck the "Refresh game to join raids" option to enable this feature.<br/>
5) Manually deleting raids will now give a confirmation to help prevent accidental deletion.  An option is available to enable or disable this feature<br/>
6) Raid autojoin no longer accepts a time interval, it now loads the next raid whenever the previous is done, ensuring optimal loading speed, while preventing any from being missed due to lag.  <br />
7) Raid status is now parsed from the response page when joining a raid through the script.  Raids that are found to be dead are permanently hidden and marked as unsharable by the script until they are purged.<br/>
8) Countess Serpina's raid information has been updated<br/>
9) A button has been added to the options page that the user can use to support us via PayPal, if one is so inclined.<br/>
10) A new /help command has been added which allows the user to submit a bug report.<br/>
11) Fixed a few styling issues, now the element containing the raids on the raid tab resizes when an option set is expanded.<br/>

6) Simple pastebin catching added, will track who posted it first so you know if it's a repeat<br/>
7) Auto import pastebin option added, will only auto import if it's a new paste or if the original poster is reposting it. <br/>
